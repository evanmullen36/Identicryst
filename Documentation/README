- added this text file for making notes
- worked on the Detail View trying to align the margins

Main.Storyboard and layout
- Online tutorial help: https://www.raywenderlich.com/5758454-uiscrollview-tutorial-getting-started
-
- moved the scrollview to be within the safe area of the Viewcontroller and not the full outer boundaries of the view
- set the image to have a constraint aspect ratio so the x-or-y size doesnt have to be hard coded but instead can scale with the picture
- added outher boundaries that were either suggested or I added manually.
